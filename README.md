This is the android test
					
***Android Developer Coding Task***

Using https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/ api, build an android app that displays a list of the 10 first posts of it. Each item should display username and title			

App architecture and good coding practices will be evaluated:
 - Clean code
 - OOP
 - Clean Architecture principles
 - Adherence to SOLID
 - Please use Rx2Java in your solution
* Focus should not be on UI design.
* Use any third party libraries to complete the task. (Dagger2, Retrofit, Realm...)
* Unit testing is encouraged.

***The exercise should be shared by forking this Git repository and shouldnâ€™t take more than 2-3 hours. You may use third party packages but we want to see your time management ability, so you may need to frop functionality but you can also add more functionality if you want.***
