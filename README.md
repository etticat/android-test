This is the android test
					
***Android Developer Coding Task***

Using https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/ api, build an android app that displays a list of the 10 first posts of it. Each item should display username and title	

We will evaluate your solution based on the following criterias:
 - Architectural decisions
 - Which libraries have been chosen
 - Your explanations on all decissions that have been made
 - Your presentation (how well you are able to convey your decisions)
 - Adherence to SOLID
 - Focus should not be on UI design.
 - Unit testing is encouraged but not required
 
Present in list, load only data that need to be updated using payloads.

***The exercise should be shared by forking this Git repository and shouldnâ€™t take more than 2-3 hours. You may use third party packages but we want to see your time management ability, so you may need to drop functionality but you can also add more functionality if you want.***
